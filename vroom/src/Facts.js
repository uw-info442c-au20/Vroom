          <h1>Facts about Carbon Emissions</h1>
            <h2>What are carbon emissions?</h2>
                <p>
                    When we talk about carbon emissions, we are specifically focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2).
                    Carbon dioxide is released into our atmosphere in multiple ways. According to the United
                    States Environmental Protection Agency, transportation generates the largest share of
                    Greenhouse gas emissions.

            <h2>Why should we be concerned with carbon emissions?</h2>
                <p>
                    Carbon emissions are a form of greenhouse gas that traps heat within the Earth’s 
                    atmosphere and causes global temperatures to rise. According to studies, the largest 
                    source of greenhouse gas emissions have been caused by human activities. This includes 
                    the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

            <h2>How can we reduce our carbon footprint?</h2>
                <p>
                A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that come from the production 
                and usage of a product or service.This includes carbon dioxide which is a gas that is most commonly 
                emitted by humans. The bulk of an individual’s carbon footprint will come from transportation, housing, 
                and food. While real solutions require actions on a global scale, there are choices that you can make in your 
                everyday life to lessen your personal impact on the environment.
