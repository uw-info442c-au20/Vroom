                <p>
                    When we talk about carbon emissions, we are specifically focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2).
                    Carbon dioxide is released into our atmosphere in multiple ways. According to the United
                    States Environmental Protection Agency, transportation generates the largest share of
                    Greenhouse gas emissions.
