# Carbon Emissions Project
## Team Vroom (Group 7): Royce Abuda, Ryan Dang, Cooper Teixeira

We created this project based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #13: [Climate Action](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/). We wanted to help people within the greater Seattle area gain a better understanding of what carbon emissions are and why they are harmful. Additionally, we are providing a carbon emissions calculator on our website for users to calculate how many grams of carbon they are emitting when they utilize various transportation methods. The user is able to easily switch between the various transportation methods to compare how many grams of carbon is emitted.
